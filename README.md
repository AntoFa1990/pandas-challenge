# Week 4 Pandas Challenge


## Overview

This analysis examines school district-wide standardized math and reading tests based on several key metrics, including average scores, school type and school budget.

## Key Findings

1. Charter schools performed better than District Schools overall, with a greater percentage of students passing both math and reading. While Charter schools showed average scores of 83.5 for Math and 83.9 for Reading, District Schools had averages scores of only 77 for Math and 81 for Reading.

2. There was not a positive correlation between greater spending per student, and average math and reading scores. Schools spending under $584 per student (the lowest spending category) achieved an average of 90% Overall Passing, while the highest spending category ($645-$675 per student) acheived only a 54% average Overall Passing.
