# Week 4 Pandas Challenge


## Overview

This analysis examines school district-wide standardized math and reading tests based on several key metrics, including average scores, school type and school budget.

## Key Findings

1. Charter schools performed better than District Schools overall, with a greater percentage of students passing both math and reading. While Charter schools showed average scores of 83.5 for Math and 83.9 for Reading, District Schools had averages scores of only 77 for Math and 81 for Reading. It is important to caveat that further study here is needed, to pinpoint exactly why this is so. Factors such as demographics, and specialty programs (like immersion schools or focused subject schools) could be significant, but were not considered in this analysis.

2. There was not a positive correlation between greater spending per student, and higher average math and reading scores. Schools spending under $584 per student (the lowest spending category) achieved an average of 90% Overall Passing, while the highest spending category ($645-$675 per student) acheived only a 54% average Overall Passing. This suggests that a better question for analysis is how money is being spent, rather than simply how much.
